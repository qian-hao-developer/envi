    1.Copy and paste the adb bash completion from here on github by mbrubeck and save in a file named adb.txt or the name you prefer.
    2.Store the file somewhere safe. Anywhere you want in your $PATH. I choose /bin but the standard file location is /usr/local/bin.
    3.Use your favorite editor of choice (which should be vim IMHO) to edit your ~/.bashrc file.

    4.Add the following lines (substitute your own path to the adb bash completion file) to the end of your ~/.bashrc file (not edit the .bashrc in sudo mode):

    if [ -e /bin/adb.txt ] ; then
      source /bin/adb.txt
    fi

    5.Save and quit. To reload your bash type:

    6.source ~/.bashrc

    7,Check if it works. Type adb d and press Tab to see if it autocompletes to adb devices.
